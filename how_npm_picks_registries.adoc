= How npm picks registries

== Question

If your project config sets

.....
registry=https://project-registry.com
.....

and your user config sets

.....
@foo:registry=https://user-registry.com
.....

and you run

.....
npm install @foo/bar
.....

then which registry will npm search?

. `project-registry`?
. `user-registry`?
. first `project-registry` and if the package isn't found then `user-registry`?
. something else?

== Answer

. npm gets its config from the command line, environment variables, and four config files — project, user, global and builtin — in order.
  The first found value for a given key, e.g. "registry", wins.
. for an unscoped package, npm picks the first unscoped registry
. for a scoped package, npm picks
.. the first same-scoped registry if it exists
.. else the first unscoped registry

So: `user-registry`.

== Remarks

When searching for any given package, npm only ever searches _one_ registry: no fallbacks.
(Contrast, say, Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories#package-source-constraint.)

The registry npm picks is a function of your config and the package name.
As far as I know, you cannot specify a package's source in the `package.json` (contrast Poetry again).

The scope is part of the package name.
For example, above, npm will search for `@foo/bar` in `user-registry`.
So the scope affects _which_ registry is searched and _what_ is searched for.

The `aws codeartifact login --tool npm` command, suggested in the "View connection instructions" popup in CodeArtifact, modifies the _user_ config file.
Beware!

== Gotcha

Suppose

. Your Team has to fetch packages from `private-registry`
. but you also sometimes work in Other Team, which insists on configuring `npm` for its projects via user config,
. and packages may be published to `private-registry` with any scope, or no scope.

How should you configure npm in Your Team?

Insist that packages published to `private-registry` have one of a fixed set of scopes?
Insist that Other Team uses project, not user, config?
Good luck.

One approach is to set

.....
registry=https://private-registry.com
.....

in Your Team's project config.

This mostly works fine: it doesn't affect Other Team, and in Your Team's project npm looks for scoped and unscoped packages in `private-registry`.

Except

. if someone publishes a package `@myorg/cowsay` to `private-registry`
. and you need it in Your Team's project
. but Other Team relies on `@myorg:registry=https://other-registry.com` in the user config,

then when you run `npm install @myorg/cowsay` in Your Team's project, npm will quietly fetch the wrong package: the one from `other-registry`, not `private-registry`.

Is there a failsafe approach?

== Evidence

=== Experiment

.....
% mkdir test_npm_registry_lookup && cd test_npm_registry_lookup
% npm init -y
% npm config set 'registry=https://project-registry.com' --location=project
% npm config set '@foo:registry=https://user-registry.com'
% cat .npmrc
registry=https://project-registry.com
% cat ~/.npmrc
@foo:registry=https://user-registry.com
% npm install @foo/bar
npm error network request to https://user-registry.com/@foo%2fbar failed
% # the point is that it looked up user-registry!
% # don't forget to clean up
% cd .. && rm -rf test_npm_registry_lookup && npm config delete '@foo:registry'
.....

=== Docs

From https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/npmrc:

* npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment variables, and `npmrc` files.
* The four relevant files are:
** per-project config file (`/path/to/my/project/.npmrc`)
** per-user config file (`~/.npmrc`)
** global config file (`$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`)
** npm builtin config file (`/path/to/npm/npmrc`)
* Each of these files is loaded, and config options are resolved in priority order.

From https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/scope:

* Scopes can be associated with a separate registry.
* You can also associate a scope with a registry using `npm config`:

.....
npm config set @myco:registry=http://reg.example.com
.....

* Once a scope is associated with a registry, any npm install for a package with that scope will request packages from that registry instead.
