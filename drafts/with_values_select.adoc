= with-values-select

To quickly test some SQL -- say, how to query our `payment_requests` table for how many times each request had failed attempts -- I used to connect to a `playground` database in my local instance and run something like this:

[source,sql]
----
-- create simple version of the actual table
create table payment_requests (
    attempts jsonb
);

-- insert test data
insert into payment_requests values
('[{"status": "FAILED"}]'::jsonb),
('[{"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}]'),
('[{"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "DECLINED"}]'),
('[{"status": "DECLINED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}]'),
('[{"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "DECLINED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}]');

-- hack my way to a working query
select
    (
        select count(*)
        from jsonb_array_elements(attempts) as attempt
        where attempt ->> 'status' = 'FAILED'
    ) as num_failures,
    count(*)
from payment_requests
group by num_failures;
----

This approach gets the job done, but has some annoying features.

* You have to connect to `playground` first. Creating and dropping random tables in a database you care about is asking for trouble.

* Unless you're disciplined about cleaning up after yourself, `playground` will get cluttered. In mine, I have tables `bar`, `blah`, `foo`, `non_empty_tbl`, `tbl`, and `tmp_tbl`. No, I don't remember what contains what, or why, or which are worth keeping.

* It's awkward to share your experiment by copy-pasting the SQL. What if your colleague doesn't have a `playground` set up, or their `playground` already has a `payment_requests` table?

* If you want to change your test cases, you have to `truncate payment_requests` first, then re-insert, else things get messy.

* It's three statements, which have to be kept and run together. But experiments like this are typically rough-and-ready: grab a console, try some things, go back to what you were working on. It's easy for the statements to get separated.

There must be a better way!

How about this?

[source, sql]
----
with payment_requests (attempts) as (
    values
    ('[{"status": "FAILED"}]'::jsonb),
    ('[{"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}]'),
    ('[{"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "DECLINED"}]'),
    ('[{"status": "DECLINED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}]'),
    ('[{"status": "FAILED"}, {"status": "DECLINED"}, {"status": "FAILED"}]')
)

select
    (
        select count(*)
        from jsonb_array_elements(attempts) as attempt
        where attempt ->> 'status' = 'FAILED'
    ) as num_failures,
    count(*)
from payment_requests
group by num_failures;
----

I had assumed that `values` could only be used as part of an `insert`. Not so: it's a command in its own right, which can be used to hard-code a table without writing to disk. For example,

[source, sql]
----
values (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three');
----

is valid SQL, "effectively equivalent", say the docs, to

[source, sql]
----
select 1 as column1, 'one' as column2
union all
select 2, 'two'
union all
select 3, 'three';
----

This `with-values-select` approach avoids the annoying features of `create-insert-select` above.

* Because you don't create or drop tables, and nothing is written to disk, it's relatively safe to run such experiments anywhere: no need to connect to `playground` first. Of course, I'm not saying you should run experimental SQL when connected to your production database. But `with-values-select` is pretty safe, much safer than `create-insert-select`, and safe enough, I think, to run even in a database you care a bit about.

* No writing to disk, so no clutter.

* Want to share it with a colleague? Just copy-paste. They don't need a `playground`, and it doesn't matter if they already have a `payment_requests` table.

* To change your test cases, just change your test cases: no truncating required.

* Because it's one statement not three, it'll probably survive intact longer.

So: `with-values-select` beats `create-insert-select`.
