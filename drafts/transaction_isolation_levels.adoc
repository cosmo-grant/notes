= Transaction isolation levels

When two transactions - groups of statements - run concurrently against a database, bad things may happen.

Like what?

== Bad things

=== Dirty read

Supposing the transactions are

[source,sql]
insert into emails (body, unread_flag) values ('hi', true);
update count set count = count + 1;

and

[source,sql]
select * from emails;
select unread from count; --- denormalized for speed

then the statements might run in this order:

[source,sql]
insert into emails (body, unread_flag) values ('hi', true);
select * from emails;
select unread from count;
update count set count = count + 1;

In a picture:

This is bad: you see the unread email but the counter still says 0.

Generically:

This is known as a _dirty read_: one transaction sees another's uncommitted changes.

=== Dirty write

This is bad: bo buys it but jo gets it.

Generically:

=== Lost update

This is bad: the application tried to increment `x` twice, but `x` ends up as 2, not 3.

Generically:

This is a _lost update_.


=== Write skew

This is bad:
one application confirms it's safe to take off the belt, then does so;
another application confirms it's safe to take off the braces, then does so;
and then your trousers fall down.

Generically:

image::../images/transaction_isolation_levels-dirty_write_generic.jpg[]

This is known as _write skew_: read-write straddles writes.

=== Read skew

This is bad: your money has vanished.

Generically:

image::../images/transaction_isolation_levels-dirty_write_generic.jpg[]

This is known as _read skew_: reads straddle writes.

unless stated otherwise, assume variables may take the same value
unshown commits/begins may occur anywhere (after the last statement in that coloured transaction)
the phenomena are not necessarily problematic, e.g. if the client didn't make a decision based on the read value
