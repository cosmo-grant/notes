= backoff's max time

What will this output?

import time

import backoff

START = time.time()

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.constant, Exception, max_time=6, interval=3, jitter=None)
def foo():
    print(f"starting foo() at t={time.time() - START:.0f}")
    time.sleep(2)
    raise Exception


if __name__ == "__main__":
    foo()
----

I assumed

[source,console]
----
starting foo() at t=0
starting foo() at t=5
Exception
----

on the basis that seven seconds have elapsed when the second attempt raises an exception, and we set `max_time` to six, so `backoff` will re-raise it.

After all, the `backoff` docs say that `max_time` "specifies the maximum amount of total time in seconds that can elapse before giving up." It can't interrupt `foo()` of course, but it sure sounds like when control passes back to `backoff`, if we've passed `max_time`, then it'll re-raise exceptions.

In fact:

[source,console]
----
% uv run backoff_test.py
starting foo() at t=0
starting foo() at t=5
starting foo() at t=8
Exception
----

This is striking for two reasons: an attempt _starts_ at t=8, after `max_time` has elapsed; and the backoff between the second and third attempts was _one_ second, despite `backoff.constant` and `interval=3`. `max_time` isn't the max time and `backoff.constant` isn't constant.

What's going on?

It turns out that `backoff` calculates `elapsed` _before_ calling the target function. Then _after_ calling the target function, no matter how much time has passed meanwhile, if `elapsed < max_time` it backs off for `min(interval, max_time - elapsed)`. In effect, `backoff` decides _before_ an attempt whether to back off and how long for, if an exception is raised.

In our example: just before the first attempt the elapsed time is zero seconds, so when the attempt raises an exception two seconds later, `backoff` backs off for three seconds; then just before the second attempt the elapsed time is five seconds, so when the attempt raises an exception two seconds later, `backoff` backs off for one second; then just before the third attempt the elapsed time is eight seconds, so when the attempt raises an exception two seconds later, `backoff` re-raises it.

I find this design odd. Why calculate the elapsed time before calling the target function, but use it after? It means that if `max_time` is crossed _while_ the target function is running, `backoff` will try again. And, given that, why cap the back off at `max_time - elapsed`?  This might be reasonable enough if it helped ensure (so far as could be ensured -- `backoff` can't predict how long the target function might take) that the total time stays below `max_time`. But `backoff` has already abandoned that aim: as we've seen, it will happily call the target function after `max_time`. Capping the back off just adds to the confusion.
