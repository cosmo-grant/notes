= How npm selects registries

== Question

If your project config sets

.....
registry=https://project-registry.com
.....

and your user config sets

.....
@foo:registry=https://user-registry.com
.....

and you run `npm install @foo/bar`, then which registry will npm select?

. just `project-registry`?
. just `user-registry`?
. first `project-registry` and if the package isn't found then `user-registry`?
. something else?

== Answer

. npm gets its config from the command line, environment variables, and four config files — project, user, global and builtin — in order.
. for an unscoped package, npm selects the first unscoped registry
. for a scoped package, npm selects
.. the first same-scoped registry if there is one
.. else the first unscoped registry

Thus: just `user-registry`.

== Remarks

The registry npm selects is a function of your config and the package name.

The scope is part of the package name.
For example, above, npm will search for `@foo/bar` in `user-registry`.
So the scope affects which registry is searched _and_ what is searched for.

The `aws codeartifact login --tool npm` command, suggested in the "View connection instructions" popup in CodeArtifact, modifies the user config file.
Beware!

== Gotcha

Suppose

. Your Team has to fetch packages from `private-registry`
. but you also sometimes work in Other Team, which insists on configuring `npm` for its projects via user config,
. and packages may be published to `private-registry` with any scope, or no scope.

How should you configure npm in Your Team?

Insist that packages published to `private-registry` have one of a fixed set of scopes?
Insist that Other Team uses project, not user, config?
Good luck.

One approach is to set

.....
registry=https://private-registry.com
.....

in your project config.

This mostly works fine:
. It doesn't affect things when working in Other Team.
. When working in Your Team, npm looks for scoped and unscoped packages in `private-registry`.

Except 
if someone publishes a package `@myorg/cowsay` to `private-registry`
and you need it in Your Team's project
but Other Team insists on `@myorg:registry=https://other-registry.com` in the user config, 
then when you run `npm install @myorg/cowsay` in Your Team's project, npm will quietly fetch the wrong package: the one from `other-registry`, not `private-registry`.

Was there a failsafe approach?

== Evidence

=== Experiment

.....
% mkdir test_npm_registry_lookup && cd test_npm_registry_lookup
% npm init -y
% npm config set 'registry=https://project-registry.com' --location=project
% npm config set '@foo:registry=https://user-registry.com'
% cat .npmrc
registry=https://project-registry.com
% cat ~/.npmrc
@foo:registry=https://user-registry.com
% npm install @foo/bar
npm error network request to https://user-registry.com/@foo%2fbar failed
# the point is that it looked up user-registry
# don't forget to clean up!
.....



=== Docs

From https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/npmrc:

. npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment variables, and `npmrc` files.
. The four relevant files are:
** per-project config file (`/path/to/my/project/.npmrc`)
** per-user config file (`~/.npmrc`)
** global config file (`$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`)
** npm builtin config file (`/path/to/npm/npmrc`)
. Each of these files is loaded, and config options are resolved in priority order.

From https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/scope:

. Scopes can be associated with a separate registry.
. You can also associate a scope with a registry using `npm config`:

.....
npm config set @myco:registry=http://reg.example.com
.....

. Once a scope is associated with a registry, any npm install for a package with that scope will request packages from that registry instead.
